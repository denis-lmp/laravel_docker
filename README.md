It's a simple docker setup to set up `Laravel` environment on local machine with `docker`.

### To run the local dev environment:
1. Place projects files into your `Laravel` project, navigate to `root` project folder.
2. Run `make install`
   It will install composer dependencies, run migration, seeders, run tests
3. Open `http://localhost` for the `Laravel Welcome` page.
